## Factors Contributing to Climate Change
-----

The black "observed" line is the GISS global land and ocean temperature record, which can be found [here](https://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/graphs_v3/). It starts in 1880.  

The colored temperature lines are the modeled estimates that each climate factor contributes to the overall temperature. Each factor was simulated five times, with different initial conditions; each trace here shows the average of five runs. GISS researchers laid out their historical simulations in detail last year in this [article](https://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/abs/mi08910y.html).

All the lines on the plot show the variance from the 1880-1910 average of the parameter.

The graph and writeup is from the [Bloomberg Climate Change graph](https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2015-whats-warming-the-world/).
